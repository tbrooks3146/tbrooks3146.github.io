        <p>
        I Enlisted in the <a href="https://www.moguard.ngb.mil" target="_blank"blank>Missouri National Army Guard</a> in June of 2017. That would make a total of almost 6 years that. I have been in the Military. In these past 6 years I have learned so many things about myself. I have learned to be a great leader. I have learned to take accountability and responsiblity. The most important thing that I have learned is that life isn't all about me and that helping others is a great thing for myself and peers that I meet throughout life.

            I am a person that is really into health and fitness. It is one of my not some hobbies. I have been working out for a total of 3 years. It is very challenging to do with myself being so busy. I really enjoy working out and lifting wieghts. It relieves stress and there are major benefits to this hobby. I workout at a <a href="https://www.bodyrefinerygym.com/" target="_blank">GYM</a> in Columbia, Missouri.
